## 🎯 Mission
Emrald builds **privacy-first cyber tools** for journalists, operators, human rights defenders, and anyone who must remain untraceable.  
We don’t ask permission.  
We don’t leave traces.  

> **Peace by readiness. Readiness by mastery.**

## 🏛 The Five Pillars of Emrald  
> *Instrumenta Operis* — "Instruments of the Work"

Each pillar is an interoperable tool — a weapon in a larger arsenal.

- 🧿 **Solomonic Protocol** — Ritual terminal for red/blue team simulation. Summon (offense). Consult (defense). Logged in an encrypted grimoire.  
- 📖 **The Hacker's Book** — Collaborative cyber range: IDE, CTFs, forums, gamified certifications.  
- 🖥 **Love & Havoc** — Hardened SSH configs, deception honeypots, OSINT utilities for secure comms and forensic acquisition.  
- 🛡 **Hacker OS USB** — Bootable offline OS with forensics, IR, and pentesting tools. Field-ready and CE-compliant.  
- ⛪ **Cathedral** — Tamper-proof archive for preserving sensitive knowledge under censorship or attack.
