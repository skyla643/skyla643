💻 **Skyla's Hacker Mind Palace** 💻

Welcome to my world. I am **Skyla Miranda Reyes**—a **grey hat hacker, cybersecurity visionary, and the CEO of Emrald**. My mission is simple: **redefine cybersecurity, innovate, and push hacking to its limits** while embracing both the beauty and chaos of technology.

> *"We create our own reality, and within it, we find both beauty and chaos."* — Hannibal Lecter

Hacking is not just a skill. **It is an art, a philosophy, a way of thinking**. It is the language of the unseen, the power of control, and the mastery of systems that others only fear. In the grey, **we find truth.**
