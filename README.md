## 🎯 Mission
Emrald builds **privacy-first cyber tools** for journalists, operators, human rights defenders, and anyone who must live off the grid by necessity or design.  

We don’t ask permission.  
We don’t leave traces.  
> **Peace by readiness. Readiness by mastery.**

## 🏛 The Five Pillars of Emrald  
> *Instrumenta Operis* — "Instruments of the Work"

Each pillar is an interoperable tool — a weapon in a larger arsenal.

- 🧿 **Solomonic Protocol** — Ritual terminal for red/blue team training. Summon (offense). Consult (defense). Logged in an encrypted grimoire.  
- 📖 **The Hacker's Book** — Collaborative cyber range: IDE, CTFs, forums, gamified certifications.  
- 🖥 **Love & Havoc** — Hardened SSH configs, deception honeypots, OSINT utilities for secure comms and forensic capture.  
- 🛡 **Hacker OS USB** — Bootable offline OS with forensics, IR, and pentesting tools. CE-compliant and field-ready.  
- ⛪ **Cathedral** — Tamper-proof archive for preserving sensitive knowledge under censorship or attack.
