## 🎯 Mission
Emrald builds **privacy-first cyber tools** for journalists, operators, human rights defenders, and anyone living off the grid by necessity or choice.  

We don’t ask permission.  
We don’t leave traces.  
> **Peace by readiness. Readiness by mastery.**

## 🏛 The Five Pillars of Emrald

> *Instrumenta Operis* — “Instruments of the Work”

Each pillar is an interoperable tool — a weapon in a larger arsenal.

- 🧿 **Solomonic Protocol** — Ritual terminal for red/blue team training and simulation. Summon (offense). Consult (defense). Every action logged in an encrypted grimoire.  
- 📖 **The Hacker’s Book** — A collaborative cyber range: real-time IDE, forums, CTF challenges, gamified certifications.  
- 🖥 **Love & Havoc** — Hardened SSH configs, deception honeypots, and OSINT utilities for secure comms and forensic capture.  
- 🛡 **Hacker OS USB** — Bootable offline OS preloaded with forensics, incident response, and penetration testing tools. Field-ready, CE-compliant.  
- ⛪ **Cathedral** — A tamper-proof archive for preserving sensitive knowledge under censorship or attack. Provenance, OCR, translation, mirrored redundancy.
